*JavaScript Neural Network with brain.js wrote by Radi Cho*

It using `brain.js` - `brain is a JavaScript neural network library`

## What's inside?

Our simple app will predict the chances - how percents the given video is boring or hot based on views, likes & shares.

* First I trained the network with simple inputs and outputs (more likes, view and shares are equal to hotter video)

* After that ran the network and Calculate percents with `Math.floor` and finally logging the results.

* You can clone and edit the Object `data` and run the app to view how `brain.js` works...
